    "## ***Explanation***\n",
    "\n",
    "*Far, far away, in an hardly accessible landscape, the mystic dragon egg lies hidden..*\n",
    "- *Goal is to find the mystic dragon egg, hidden in a faraway clearing.\n",
    "  To awaken the egg, you need a magic spell from a mage in the tower.\n",
    "  However, it would help if you navigated through challenges and traps to find it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## ***Additional Features*** \n",
    "*To make the game even more unique, more creative interactions, puzzles, and challenges were added that require the player to make strategic decisions. Here are some additional features:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Customizable Player Actions:*** *Players can choose between multiple actions (talk, fight, sneak, etc.) in certain rooms for more dynamic interactions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Energy System:*** *Players will have an energy level that decreases with each move, and they must manage it wisely.*\n",
    "- ***Hidden Rooms:*** *The secret cave can be discovered only if the player has the amulet.*\n",
    "- ***Dynamic Weather:*** *Weather in the forest can change, affecting the player's movement and interactions (e.g., a storm may block certain paths).*\n",
    "- ***Riddle and Charm:*** *Add a mysterious charm that is needed to safely take the dragon egg, adding a riddle-solving element.*\n",
    "- ***New Items:*** *A potion can be found in the secret cave, and it restores 30 energy when used.*\n",
    "- ***Energy Restoration:*** *The player can use potions to restore energy.*\n",
    "- ***Multiple Endings:*** *The game can end based on the player's decisions—either by finding the dragon egg and awakening it or by failing (e.g., egg breaking, health reaching zero, etc.).*\n",
    "  - ***Good Ending:*** *The player safely finds the egg and awakens it in the tower.*\n",
    "  - ***Neutral Ending:*** *The player finds the egg but runs out of energy before reaching the tower.*\n",
    "  - ***Bad Ending:*** *The egg is broken either by the bear or by a storm.*\n",
    "- ***Broken Egg:*** *The egg can be broken. If the player has the dragon egg but doesn't have honey to give to the bear, the bear might break the egg. If the player has the dragon egg but doesn't have the amulet during a storm, the storm can damage the egg, leading to failure.* \n",
    "  \n",
    "## ***Gameplay overview***\n",

    "- *Move between different Room rooms by typing the name of the room.*\n",

    "- *Manage your energy wisely and collect the necessary items to finish the game.*\n",
