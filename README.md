The Dragon Egg Game

# ***QUEST FOR THE DRAGON EGG***

## ***Explanation***

*Far, far away, in an hardly accessible landscape, the mystic dragon egg lies hidden..*
- *Goal is to find the mystic dragon egg, hidden in a faraway clearing.
  To awaken the egg, you need a magic spell from a mage in the tower.
  However, it would help if you navigated through challenges and traps to find it.*

## ***Additional Features*** 
*To make the game even more unique, more creative interactions, puzzles, and challenges were added that require the player to make strategic decisions. Here are some additional features:*

- ***Customizable Player Actions:*** *Players can choose between multiple actions (talk, fight, sneak, etc.) in certain rooms for more dynamic interactions.*

- ***Energy System:*** *Players will have an energy level that decreases with each move, and they must manage it wisely.*
- ***Hidden Rooms:*** *The secret cave can be discovered only if the player has the amulet.*
- ***Dynamic Weather:*** *Weather in the forest can change, affecting the player's movement and interactions (e.g., a storm may block certain paths).*
- ***Riddle and Charm:*** *Add a mysterious charm that is needed to safely take the dragon egg, adding a riddle-solving element.*
- ***New Items:*** *A potion can be found in the secret cave, and it restores 30 energy when used.*
- ***Energy Restoration:*** *The player can use potions to restore energy.*
- ***Multiple Endings:*** *The game can end based on the player's decisions—either by finding the dragon egg and awakening it or by failing (e.g., egg breaking, health reaching zero, etc.).*
  - ***Good Ending:*** *The player safely finds the egg and awakens it in the tower.*
  - ***Neutral Ending:*** *The player finds the egg but runs out of energy before reaching the tower.*
  - ***Bad Ending:*** *The egg is broken either by the bear or by a storm.*
- ***Broken Egg:*** *The egg can be broken. If the player has the dragon egg but doesn't have honey to give to the bear, the bear might break the egg. If the player has the dragon egg but doesn't have the amulet during a storm, the storm can damage the egg, leading to failure.*

## ***Important Game Mechanics***
### ***Energy Management:***

*Each player will start with 100 energy, but each move decreases your energy randomly by 5 to 15 points. If your energy reaches 0, the game is over.
Keep an eye on your energy by typing energy and plan your moves wisely to conserve it.*

### ***Moves Left:***

*Each player has a total of 12 moves to complete the game. Each time you move to a new room, the number of moves decreases.*

### ***Items:***

*Each player will need certain items to progress in the game:*

- ***Honey:*** *Used to distract the bear in the forest. This protects the egg from the bear. If players have no honey or charm, the bear will break the egg and the mission will fail.*
- ***Dragon Egg:*** *The game's main goal is to find and protect this until the egg is awakened.*
- ***Amulet:*** *Found at the riverbank, this item is needed to protect the dragon egg from storms and fog which are environmental hazards or bears. Also, if the player enters the secret cave without the charm, they will fall and the egg will break.*

### ***Expected Behavior:***
- ***Amulet + No Honey:*** *If the player has the amulet but no honey, the charm will still protect the egg from the bear.*
- ***No amulet + No Honey:*** *If the player has neither the amulet nor honey, the bear will break the egg.*
- ***Honey:*** *If the player has honey, the bear is distracted, and the player can safely pass, regardless of whether they have the charm.*

### ***Random Events:***

*The forest and some other rooms have random events, such as riddles or weather changes. Be prepared to adapt!*

## ***How to Win this Game***
- *Explore the rooms and solve riddles to find the dragon egg in the clearing.*
- *Make sure to visit the riverbank to collect the amulet, which will allow you to safely awaken the egg.*
- *Protect the Dragon Egg as you travel through the dangerous forest.*
- *If you do have not enough energy, you need to find a potion. By using the potion you can gain 30 energy.*
- *Once you have the dragon egg and the charm, go to the tower to get the spell from the mage.*
- *Use the spell to awaken the dragon egg, and you win the game!*
- *However, there are dangers along the way—such as a bear in the forest and harsh weather conditions that could break the egg if you're not prepared.*
